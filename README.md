# IP Messaging Starter Application for iOS, using Objective-C

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your
own messaging apps with Twilio IP Messaging. Before we begin, we need to collect
all the credentials we need to run the application:

Credential | Description
---------- | -----------
Twilio Account SID | Your main Twilio account identifier - [find it on your dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/user/account).
IP Messaging Service SID | Like a database ID for all your messaging app's data. Info on how to create one below.
API Key | Used to authenticate - [generate one here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/messaging/dev-tools/api-keys).
API Secret | Used to authenticate - [just like the above, you'll get one here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/messaging/dev-tools/api-keys).
TwiML App | Generate one [using this repo](https://github.com/twilio/mobile-quickstart)

## A Note on API Keys

When you generate an API key pair at the URLs above, your API Secret will only
be shown once - make sure to save this in a secure location, 
or possibly your `~/.bash_profile`.

## Creating a Service SID

A service instance provides a shared scope for all the messages, users, and data
in our IP Messaging application. It's like a new database for all your app's data.

To create one, we can use the [REST API](/docs/api/ip-messaging/rest) - execute 
the following curl command in your terminal to create a service instance, whose 
SID you can use in your application. Replace `YourAppName` with an identifier
you would like to use, and `{api key}` and `{api secret}` with the values you
got from the step above.

```bash
curl -XPOST https://ip-messaging.twilio.com/v1/Services \
    -d "FriendlyName=YourAppName" \
    -u '{api key}:{api secret}'
```

Your new service SID will be prefixed with an `IS` in the JSON data you get back.

## Setting Up The iOS App

The app uses Cocoapods for dependencies.  Run 'pod install' to install the dependencies, then open IPMQuickstart.xcworkspace to view the project. 

Once you've compiled and run the project and you're good to go! The app will generate a username and autoconnect to the 'general' channel
